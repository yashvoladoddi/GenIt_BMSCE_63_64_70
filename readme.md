GenIt:-

GenIt is an image generating software (based on Gradio).

It is a rethinking of Stable Diffusion and Midjourneyâ€™s designs:
    Learned from Stable Diffusion, the software is offline, open source, and free.
    Learned from Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.

GenIt has included and automated lots of inner optimizations and quality improvements. 
Users can forget all those difficult technical parameters, and just enjoy the interaction between human and computer to "explore new mediums of thought and expanding the imaginative powers of the human species"

GenIt has simplified the installation process. 
Minimal GPU memory requirement is 4GB (Nvidia).

To run this application:-
1) Download [this link](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus/releases/download/release/Fooocus_win64_2-1-831.7z)
2) Click on 'run.bat'
3) Wait for a while before the batch file boots up
4) Then the models are downloaded from huggingface
5) Finally the website loads up, and thus then ready to use.
